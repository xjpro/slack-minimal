# slack-minimal

A custom stylesheet that makes Slack look like something in between 'Clean' and 'Compact'. For use with Sylish, a Chrome extension. Could also work with similar extensions in other browsers but I have not tested them. 

Note: Your Slack message layout should be set to 'Clean'.

### Usage ###

Create a new rule in Stylish with these settings:

* Applies to URLs on the domain: slack.com

Then paste the code from the .css file in this repo into the code section. Set as enabled and save.
